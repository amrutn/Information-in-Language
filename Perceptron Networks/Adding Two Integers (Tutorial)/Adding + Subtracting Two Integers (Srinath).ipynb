    "Hi! This notebook will serve as a tutorial to walk through the basics of this project. In this notebook, we will model the truthfulness of a class of mathematical statements that amount to the addition of two integers between -5 and 5. We need to limit the range of integers because it would take an infinite amount of compute power to fully conceptualize the addition of any two integers with no bounds. \n",

    "3. Generating training and validation datasets for our statements. These datasets should consist of input vectors that represent legal statements in the \"sub-language\" and the associated truth values for each of these statements. \n",
    "4. Use the data to train a set of neural networks with different structures neural complexities. The ones with training error below a certain threshold will be validated. We will be using a threshold value of 0.05 for this notebok. The networks with validation error below that threshold will be classified as \"good\" networks and the \"good\" network with minimal neural complexity will be used as the final model to represent the statements. \n",
    "5. (optional) Try finding the information complexity (the amount data it takes to train the network) of that network structure by training it with different amounts of training data and seeing how much training data is required for it to have training and validation errors below the threshold. \n",
    "6. Save the statistics from the final network. This will include things such as the final neural complexity (the number of hidden layer nodes in the network), information complexity (the amount data it takes to train the network), final validation/training error, final weights of the network and plots of the training error as the number of training cycles increases.
